## Given a string of characters, write a function to search through the string and return the first non-repeated character.

### Challenge:

Write a function or set of functions that takes...

- A string.

And returns...

- first letter in the string that is not repeated anywhere else in the string.
- an empty string in the case that there are no unique characters / letters.

NOTE:

- letters should be considered the same regardless of case.
- function should still return the letter from the string in the correct case that it was originally in.
- function should handle any unicode character
